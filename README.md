## What the heck is a BBD?

BBD is a static BBC clone utilizing images from the dog.ceo API to replace the article images. The page is fully responsive and adjusts itself depending on the viewport size, intended to function similarly to the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/) website.

You can find the online copy of this repository at the website https://bbdnews.netlify.app/.

## What is it for?

BBD is a site clone test made from scratch using only the main BBC page as a template for the project. Images come from the [dog.ceo](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) API to generate the images on page load.

The goal of this project was to emulate the BBC website as close as possible, barring some aspects such as the articles or the navbar going to different places in the site. There are a few things that are not present on BBD; namely the nav being put into a dropdown menu, the sign-in being replaced with an icon on certain device widths, and the stylization of the search bar.

Aside from those aspects, the site should be functional on all major device widths. Due to the way the site is setup, you can generate new article images by refreshing the page. Give it a try!
